## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)
- [Mysql] (https://www.mysql.com/)
- [postgresql] (https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Spring Boot] (https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Swagger] (https://swagger.io/)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `de.codecentric.springbootsample.Application` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Deploying the application to Heroku

The easiest way to deploy the sample application to Heroku is to use the [Heroku CLI](https://dashboard.heroku.com/):

```shell
oc new-app codecentric/springboot-maven3-centos~https://github.com/codecentric/springboot-sample-app
```

This will create:

* An ImageStream called "springboot-maven3-centos"
* An ImageStream called "springboot-sample-app"
* A BuildConfig called "springboot-sample-app"
* DeploymentConfig called "springboot-sample-app"
* Service called "springboot-sample-app"

If you want to access the app from outside your Heroku installation, you have to expose the springboot-sample-app service:

```shell
oc expose springboot-sample-app --hostname=www.example.com
```
